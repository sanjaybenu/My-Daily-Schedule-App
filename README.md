# My Daily Work Scheduler App


## Description

The objective of this app is to provide a tool to an employee, so that the employee can create a daily work plan.

The app shows the current day and current time on the top of the page and has hourly slots to fill in the work/meetings etc scheduled for the workday.

Slots are also colour coded to indicate if the slot represents the hour which is in the past or in the future in relations to the current hour. Present hour is represented by a different colour.



## Usage

When the app is loaded, employee is presented with a page with a heading and current date and time. Time shown keeps updating every 1 sec., to mimic a clock.
